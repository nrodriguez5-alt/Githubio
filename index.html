      <h2>Short Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a Cuban American independent artist and music student focused on building a sustainable career outside traditional industry paths.
        My work blends rap and melodic songwriting, and I’m interested in how technology and direct fan relationships can support long-term creative independence.

      <h2>What I’m Working On</h2>
      <p>
        Right now I’m focused on releasing music consistently, improving my production and writing, and learning how to build repeatable systems around my art.

    <section>
      <h2 id="toggleHeading">What I Care About Right Now</h2>
      <p id="toggleText" style="display:none;">
        I’m curious about how artists can use emerging technology to stay independent without burning out or chasing hype.
        I care about ownership, real fan connection, and building things that last instead of optimizing for short-term attention.
        If you’re interested in where music, culture, and new tools overlap in a more thoughtful way, that’s what I’m exploring.
